	<center><h1>Research</h1></center>
    <p style="text-align:justify">To better understand the problems with Student Health at Victoria University, mainly targeting the current booking system, I interviewed a few students who have used the service. The people interviewed include domestic, international and exchange students, ranging from year 1 to postgraduate. The interviews were basically conducted in informal conversations where I asked several prepared questions and noted down the responses.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">Almost all the students interviewed have encountered the problem of getting a timely appointment which is desired to be within 3 days for most of them. The average waiting time for a booked appointment during trimester 1/2 is around one week, where some would decide to seek alternative solutions (other clinics/self-medication) or cancel the appointment after waited for a while. Also a few attempted to call several other times after the first call hoping to get an earlier appointment in case there was a cancellation. From my personal experience using the service, 4 out of 5 times I called to make an appointment I had to wait for at least a week. The only time I got my appointment right on the day and was provided with several other options within the week was when I called at 8.30 in the morning.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">From the interview results, I reckon one of the root causes is that the schedules of the clinics are not visible to students, which leads to a less fair system that depends more on luck and random factors. For example, if there is a cancellation for the afternoon appointment at 11 am, someone who called at 11:05 am will get the on-the-day appointment instead of someone who called earlier at 10 am.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">Besides, I wrote an email to Student Health wishing to collect some previously done surveys but there was no response yet. A larger scale of data would make the research outcome more accurate, even though the problem is already quite obvious.</p>
